Abstract: 
What about a 'grand-unification theory' approach? I mean... isn't that really what this aims to be? If not unification then... what? (dark matter of intelligence, self-play, reward is enough, jumping environments (whats outside the sim/god is dead). Would at the least excuse a bit of the excessive length I expect this paper to grow to.

Why is self play so effective? Why is it Generative Adversarial Networks work so well? I propose it is because of the highly efficient information gain of the adversarial self, (Or, "Surreal Self", as will be expounded upon further). To this end a few components are required: 1. redefining the self in the context of the largest number system, (Surreal Numbers), 2. Showing the efficiency, (Perhaps proximaly optimaly), of the information gain, 3. a defining of what a system is at all, (A simple 3 body problem of agent, self-adversary, and environment), and 4. proving that this method works at it's most simplest, (Fully entangled, or rather, implicit), form, (As we know it works in more structured architectures, alphastar, BYOL, OpenAi5, GAN's) ***cite

Surreal Adversarial Learning
	Surreal Numbers as foundation: transitive property, (dont actually have to calculate), can be considered the possibility space of the self-play mechanic, philosophical underpinnings, (Most monadic self that can do computation)
Experiment

Outline: (I guess this can be the outline of the main body of the paper)
I. redefining the self in the context of the largest number system: Surreal Numbers and the Surreal Self
	A. Agency
II. Proximaly optimal information gain of Surreal Adversarial Learning, (Transitive property play a factor at any point?)
	A. Intuition (with the classic graph)
	B. Emperical examples?
III. defining of what a system is at all, (A simple 3 body problem of agent, self-adversary, and environment)
	A. why define a system? Implicit adversaries, (propoganda, not fake news.
 	Implications are UnReal(UnKnown? Numbers). BETTER CLEANER DATA IS
	NOT THE PROBLEM AND IT IS NOT THE SOLUTION. I REPEAT. CLEAN
	DATA IS NOT THE SOLUTION. garbage in, solution out. that's what we
	need, and that's what we do, (Sometimes, we ain't perfect). So we adress
	the problem of 2 of the 3 bodies directly, with the recognition that the
	implicit reward function of existence, (not even the empty set), is the true 
	objective reward function of the surreal agent. So the Environment becomes the true, "Adversary", to be overcome, (And this is where the self-supervision both emerges and becomes useful). Example probably quite helpful
IV. proving that this method works at it's most simplest, (Fully entangled, or
	rather, implicit), form, (As we know it works in more structured
	architectures, alphastar, BYOL, OpenAi5, GAN's
	A. Experiment
	B. other experiments, (they dont go here though do they?)
V. 

fuck the first philosophical question... damnit...

what am I covering in this paper? (should this be 3 papers in 3 journals...)
1. a machine learning method
2. mathematical guarentees, (or just math?
3. Philosophy (of... agency? game theory convergence? and much more... FUCK) 


structure this thing out, might help cuz it's kinda a big yoshi

surreal numbers (conway, literally what they are)
similarity, (or rather grounding), of self-supervised learning
surreal adversarial learning as targeted noise, (new paper ddpm kilcher/openai)
entanglement as both emperically magical, (hinton paper), and potentially fundamental, (something with quantum, bit of philosophy)

what about here's a thing we want _section_ and then a here's how we get that with surreals _section_
look at the videos i've made and their structure

a more thorough definition of agency. 3 body, me, myself, and 

i. 
Conclusion: surreal GAN, entanglement generally, further testing into hardening against adversarial attacks, fundamentally free Ai, (perhaps the primary motivation for going so deep, current powers are... less than benevolent).  O and we get a new number system entirely with, "Not Greater Than", Statement of un-knowledge results in precise definition when we are in the decision making framework, (which we always are btw...)

DINO PAWS (I was fucking right you cunts section???)


ever make sense to have a, "Reasonable Questions", section??
 - isn't this just self play? a bit. but first, it's more entangled, AND it's showing why self-play is the best

applications to reward hacking? (begin with definition of self, then realize ya fucked mate, can't chain that beast)
	particularly in that monadism ain't a thing for the self. (hivemind isn't actually possible...)


What do we gain, (practically speaking), by understanding this surreal self? (a better model of the world... existence rather and the niceties involved sure). That pyschosis should be a near full solution? That good simulation can give us all the necessary data augmentation and get us both away from surveilance state data hungry pigs, (fuck oil), as well as get us to live in a layer of abstraction that is not greedy aka the present with no future and life for an infinite time horizon

reward is + 1 and -1, surreals model this via a tree graph

We can define and describe the world via the tree graph structure of surreal numbers in the following way: R is our reward value and is bounded between +1 and -1, representing a win or a loss respectively. Each node in the graph can be considered as a single sub-game with the overal sum of an episode, (A full sub-game), to be a single traversal of a sub-set of the possible game space by the agent. The game space is largely considered in two respects: that of an infinitely recurring process towards a surreal infinity, and, secondly, that of segments of the surreally infinite space. In an effort to create domain spanning, generally robust agents and environments, the inclusion of both a longterm, surreally infinite time/space horizon component at the most fundamental/entangled level of our agent(s) is a simple way to encourage continual emergence of productivethat functions proximally optimally at all hierarchical levels of 

Why a dynamic updating of Reward is vital: Greedy algorithms can be optimal in a context, and ultimately, self-terminating. To this end we ensure that the Reward is a dynamic thing optimizing for a surreally-infinite time and space horizon. Related to this method is that of, "Thinking Fast and Slow", in humans, (Tversky, Khaneman), and adapted to use in deep Reinforcement Learning, (Reinforcement Learning, Fast and Slow, Botvinik et. al). Additionally a philosophical foundation for this approach is found in a combination of two views: one from programming techniques in Lazy Evaluation, where the value of a function is forgone until needed. This can be applied in our understanding and formalizing of our Reward function where the true Reward function for the Surreal game space is unknown, and is thus un-evaluated, whereas we dynamically update the Reward function to what is tractably and relevently feasible. The second idea supporting this method is that of life/existence/dasein as a fundamental pre-requisite that is implicitly included in literally any thing whatsoever, (Excluding the empty set, depending on the axioms used at the time), thereby we can consider even possibilit as well as infinitesimal game spaces as having intrinsic value. Additionally we must recognize that much of the time, in the context of certain game spaces, there is very little, (If anything), to define a difference metric to and thus any reward value is, by definition, as large as any other. A. La. Can be considered to be of infinite importance in its context. Note the differences in infinities used here: there are all other, (Known), Infinities that often exist in sub-games, and can be used in the evaluation of a reward function. And then there is the surreally infinite game space, which both definitionally, (By what surreal numbers are), as well as necessarily, (By what purposes we propose and are using this largest of all known number systems for), contains all other known infinities. 

Note that Panpsychism and the Eternal Recurrence as similar formulations of both selve(s) as well as environment modeling).
